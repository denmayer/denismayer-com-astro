AI news moves fast. Last week, Google's NotebookLM became a big topic. This new tool summarizes your documents, web pages, or pasted text accurately and quickly. The killer feature... it produces human-like podcasts from your data. Great for studying or catching up in the car, on a walk, bike, or treadmill. Jeff Su has put together a great 13-minute tutorial.
